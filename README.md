# Registration Form

This project is a simple web application that features a registration form built with HTML, styled with CSS, and enhanced with JavaScript for interactivity.

## Features

- **User Registration:** Allows users to input their information such as username, email, password, etc.
- **Validation:** Implements client-side validation to ensure the entered data meets the required criteria.
- **Submit Functionality:** Upon successful validation, the form can be submitted, possibly for further server-side processing.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Markup language for structuring the form elements.
- **CSS:** Stylesheets for designing and formatting the form layout.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity to the form, such as validation and submission handling.

## Usage

To use this registration form:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Fill out the form fields with the required information.
4. Submit the form.

## How It Works

- **HTML Structure:** The `index.html` file contains the structure of the registration form using HTML elements such as `<form>`, `<input>`, etc.
- **CSS Styling:** The `styles.css` file provides the visual styling for the form elements to make it user-friendly and visually appealing.
- **JavaScript Interactivity:** The `script.js` file handles the client-side validation and submission of the form. It validates user inputs such as email format, password strength, etc., and prevents the form from being submitted if there are validation errors.
